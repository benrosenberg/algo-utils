# algo-utils
Python utilities for solving LeetCode (and similar) problems, with the goal of not using libraries outside of the [Python Standard Library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html). Some utilities may be implemented already in the standard library, but are reimplemented here for completeness.

Documentation generated with `python -m pdoc --html --output docs . --force --template-dir docs\templates` from the root directory. Requires [pdoc](https://pdoc3.github.io/pdoc/).
